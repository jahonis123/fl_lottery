# fl_lottery
The goal of this repo is to identify the expected values of each ticket in the Florida lottery compared to their ticket prices.

This was a fun project inspired by a family purchase of a few scratch off lottery tickets one day. I wanted to know: what lottery tickets give your the best value for each dollar spent. Feel free to clone and use the code in this repository to find out!

From my quick research into this question, I found that the more expensive lottery tickets have the highest Expected Value:Dollar Spent ratio (like the $20 Gold Rush Limited ticket at 0.81) and that the cheaper lottery tickets have a lower Expected Value:Dollar Spent ratio (like the $50,000 Gold Rush at .59).
